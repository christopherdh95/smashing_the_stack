For this project I got help from:
My professor: Steven Myers : Communication via mail.
My AI: Behnood : Debugging for almost 2 hours post lab session.
My classmate: Gary : Setting of offset

All of them helped me a lot in the debugging of Part4 although I have not been able to sucuessfully bring up the shell i.e conduct the attack.
My all other parts have been working correctly but for some unknown reason(to me) my Part4 is not working but the people mentioned above did help me a lot.
Behnood especially sat with me for a 2 hour long debugging session. I would like to thank each and every one of them.
